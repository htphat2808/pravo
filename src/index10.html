        At our office, we follow the extensive infection control recommendations
        outlined by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA),
        the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and the Centers for Disease
        Control and Prevention (CDC). In fact, we go above and beyond many of
        these requirements because we are dedicated to protecting the health and

        In addition, our team of professionals sterilizes all reusable equipment
        after each use, including handpieces. We use an autoclave, which is a
        device that kills bacteria and viruses by steam, heat and pressure. When
        possible, we use disposable materials and tools to eliminate the risk of
        cross contamination through reuse.
