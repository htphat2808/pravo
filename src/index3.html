            I was 12 years old when I decided I wanted to be a dentist. I was
            blessed to have a mother who was a dental hygienist that quit her
            own practice of dentistry to be my mom but never lost her love of
            the profession. I had great friends and examples that encouraged my
            education and dreams. My college years allowed me to pursue my love
            and amazement of the human body, the relationships of loving people
            and the environment that surrounds us.

            Pediatric dentistry is the best job in the whole world. With the
            specialty of pediatric dentistry, we are able to use new,
            state-of-the-art and “tried-and-true” techniques to provide a dental
            environment that children can thrive in. I love the emphasis that is
            placed on child growth and development. Each child is special with
            individual needs. This makes for a vibrant, stimulating and
            rewarding environment to practice the art and science of pediatric
            dental medicine.

            I grew up in Brigham City, Utah, where, as a youth and avid scouter,
            I was inspired to become a dentist by my Scoutmaster. I set my
            sights on dentistry and began preparing for this career as early as
            high school and continued on to Utah State University studying
            biology, chemistry, and public health. I received my Doctor of
            Dental Medicine from the University of Nevada, Las Vegas School of
            Dental Medicine, and pediatric specialty training at the University
            of Nebraska Medical Center and the Children’s Hospital & Medical
            Center.
