            I was 12 years old when I decided I wanted to be a dentist. I was
            blessed to have a mother who was a dental hygienist that quit her
            own practice of dentistry to be my mom but never lost her love of
            the profession. I had great friends and examples that encouraged my
            education and dreams. My college years allowed me to pursue my love
            and amazement of the human body, the relationships of loving people
            and the environment that surrounds us.

              We invite and encourage parents to be involved in this process and
              try to teach families a better way of life. Sure, times can be
              very challenging, but I have resolved that a tender heart,
              kindness and compassion help to make friends and better patients,
              as opposed to being a mean or scary authoritarian that forces
              children to behave because of fear. We get to work with the
              greatest clientele in the world, and even when things get tough,
              they are willing to give you a fist bump or a hug when we finish
              our work.

              I love the outdoors and participate in many outdoor sporting and
              recreational activities. I love to run and challenge my mind and
              body with endurance races. I have completed over 100 marathons or
              ultra-marathons, and this is my guilty pleasure after a hard day
              of work. I have a long affiliation with Boy Scouting and love to
              teach youth, for in them is where our future lies.
