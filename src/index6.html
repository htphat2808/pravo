            I grew up in Brigham City, Utah, where, as a youth and avid scouter,
            I was inspired to become a dentist by my Scoutmaster. I set my
            sights on dentistry and began preparing for this career as early as
            high school and continued on to Utah State University studying
            biology, chemistry, and public health. I received my Doctor of
            Dental Medicine from the University of Nevada, Las Vegas School of
            Dental Medicine, and pediatric specialty training at the University
            of Nebraska Medical Center and the Children’s Hospital & Medical
            Center.

              I believe it is very important for all children to have access to
              quality dental care and to feel empowered with the knowledge and
              resources to have a healthy smile for life. A positive dental
              experience combines the very best care tailored to each child’s
              unique personality and needs with a relationship built on trust
              and communication.

              My goal as a pediatric dentist is to provide a dental home and
              gentle care for infants, children, adolescents and patients with
              special needs.

            in Utah. We love this great state and are excited to get back to
            many of the outdoor activities we love, as well as watching our two
            wonderful kiddos discover new and exciting things. Thank you for
