        I grew up in Brigham City, Utah, where, as a youth and avid scouter, I
        was inspired to become a dentist by my Scoutmaster. I set my sights on
        dentistry and began preparing for this career as early as high school
        and continued on to Utah State University studying biology, chemistry,
        and public health. I received my Doctor of Dental Medicine from the
        University of Nevada, Las Vegas School of Dental Medicine, and pediatric
        specialty training at the University of Nebraska Medical Center and the
        Childrenâ€™s Hospital & Medical Center.

      I love being a pediatric dentist! It is the perfect blend of art, science
      and fun! It allows me to work with the most kind, happy and entertaining
      population.
