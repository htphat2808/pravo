          I believe it is very important for all children to have access to
          quality dental care and to feel empowered with the knowledge and
          resources to have a healthy smile for life. A positive dental
          experience combines the very best care tailored to each child’s unique
          personality and needs with a relationship built on trust and
          communication.

          My goal as a pediatric dentist is to provide a dental home and gentle
          care for infants, children, adolescents and patients with special
          needs.

        After spending many years away, my wife and I are excited to be back in
        Utah. We love this great state and are excited to get back to many of
        the outdoor activities we love, as well as watching our two wonderful
        kiddos discover new and exciting things. Thank you for entrusting your
        child’s dental care to us!
