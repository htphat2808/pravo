          I received my bachelor’s degree from Brigham Young University in 1982,
          my Doctor of Dental Medicine from Medical College of Virginia/Virginia
          Commonwealth University in 1987 and my pediatric dental specialty
          training from Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center in 1989.

          Outside of dentistry, most of my interests are located out-of-doors.
          Utah provides a wealth of incredible recreational activities. Winter
          brings skiing and snowboarding in the mountains of Utah and Canada. In
          the spring and fall, I love to explore Utah canyons, both on
          motorcycles and hiking to remote canyon areas. Summer finds me boating
          the Utah lakes with my children and grandchildren. I also love tending
          to my garden and vineyard.
