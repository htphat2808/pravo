        I was 12 years old when I decided I wanted to be a dentist. I was
        blessed to have a mother who was a dental hygienist that quit her own
        practice of dentistry to be my mom but never lost her love of the
        profession. I had great friends and examples that encouraged my
        education and dreams. My college years allowed me to pursue my love and
        amazement of the human body, the relationships of loving people and the
        environment that surrounds us.

      I chose to specialize in pediatric dentistry because I get to be involved
      with children all day long and help them to grow and be healthy.
